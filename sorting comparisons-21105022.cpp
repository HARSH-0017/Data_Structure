/*Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that continuously steps through the list and compares the adjacent pairs to
  sort the elements. In contrast, selection sort is a sorting algorithm that takes the smallest
  value (considering ascending order) in the list and moves it to the proper position in the array.
  1)NO. OF COMPARISONS:
      Selection sort performs a smaller number of swaps compared to bubble sort.
      The total number of comparisons in bubble sort is, therefore, is (n - 1) + (n - 2)... (2) + (1) = n(n - 1)/2 or O(n2)
      Number of selection sort comparisons  =  1/2(N2+N)
  2)NO. OF SWAPS:
      Selection sort performs (at most) n � 1 swaps between data elements,
      while the bubble sort swaps n * (n � 1) / 2 elements in the worst case (when the list is sorted in reverse order).

BONUS QUESTION

TIME COMPLEXITY OF BUBBLE SORT
   In the worst-case scenario, the outer loop runs O(n) times.
   As a result, the worst-case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n x n) = O(n x n) (n2).


TIME COMPLEXITY OF SELECTION SORT
   The worst case is when the array is completely unsorted or sorted in descending order. So, we will traverse the entire
   array for checking, and in each iteration, we will perform the searching operation. After searching, we will swap the
   element at its correct position. As we know that the swapping only takes a constant amount of time i.e. O(1)O(1) so
   the worst time complexity of selection sort also comes out to be O(N^2).
